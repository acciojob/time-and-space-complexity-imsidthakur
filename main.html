	  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time complexity, which is crucial for optimizing performance.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size. It is often expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how the space requirement grows with the input size.</p>
